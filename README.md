# HDF5-FEMNIST

HDF5-FEMNIST enables easy access and fast loading to the FEMNIST dataset from [LEAF](https://leaf.cmu.edu) with the help of [HDF5](https://github.com/h5py/h5py).

There are currently limited public accessable federated datasets for research purpose. As one of the most popular and early datasets, FEMNIST is implemented under LEAF framework which is rarely used by majorities of researchers newadays. [Tensorflow-Federated](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/emnist/load_data) has a buildin version of FEMNIST. But for the TyTorch users, there are now easy access to the FEMNIST datasets.
